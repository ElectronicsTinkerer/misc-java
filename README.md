# misc-java
Some of my Java code CLI utilities and programs.

# Contents:
* CSVParser   - A small implementation of a CSV parser (parses a single line with an optional custom delimiter).
* FizzBuzz    - An implementation of the classic FizzBuzz programming problem (with lots of extra features).
* GenNumbers  - A program to fill a file with N random numbers. (e.g. for testing sorting programs).
* TripleHashedLinkedList - A special data structure to store linked lists of data using three Object keys (basically a HashTable that has three input keys and returns the corresponding collision LinkedList of entries)
