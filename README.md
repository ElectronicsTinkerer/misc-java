# misc-java
Some of my Java code CLI utilities and programs.

# Contents:
* `CSVParser`   - A small implementation of a CSV parser (parses a single line with an optional custom delimiter).
* `FizzBuzz`    - An implementation of the classic FizzBuzz programming problem (with lots of extra features).
* `GenNumbers`  - A program to fill a file with N random numbers. (e.g. for testing sorting programs).
* `TrigTableGenerator` - A program to generate tables of common math functions. (Designed to have the output used in low-power environments where space is less important than computational time).
* `TripleHashedLinkedList` - A special data structure to store linked lists of data using three Object keys (basically a HashTable that has three input keys and returns the corresponding collision LinkedList of entries).
